## 📂 Projects
1. **Personal Profile**: https://github.com/nondumiso03/personal-profile
- My first ever project!
- Focused on simplicity and ease of use.
- Implemented using HTML and JavaScript.



2. **TechnoByteSolutions**: https://github.com/nondumiso03/techno_byte_solutions_website

- TechnoByteSolutions - is a dynamic website developed as my final year class project. It demonstrates a full-stack Java EE web application using JSP and Servlets, hosted on a GlassFish server. The project was built using NetBeans IDE and showcases practical skills in Java web development.

Technologies Used:
- Java (JEE)
- HTML
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- Servlets
- GlassFish Server
- NetBeans IDE

NB: You can run this project in two ways:

a) **Using an IDE (e.g., NetBeans)**  
   - Import the project into NetBeans IDE
   - Configure the GlassFish server in your IDE
   - Run the project directly from the IDE

b) **Using a WAR File**  
   - Package the project as a '.war' file from NetBeans
   - Deploy the WAR file to any compatible servlet container (e.g GlassFish)
   - Access the application through the server's configured URL
     
**License**:
This project is for educational purposes and was created as part of my final year coursework.



3. **Cleaning Services website**: https://github.com/nondumiso03/cleaning_service_website
